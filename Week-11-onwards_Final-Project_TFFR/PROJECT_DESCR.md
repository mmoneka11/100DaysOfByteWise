## Sample Project:

### Project: Intelligent Energy Consumption Predictor

### Problem Statement: 
Develop an AI-powered system that predicts energy consumption for buildings based on historical usage patterns, weather forecasts, and building characteristics.

### Major Components:

1. Energy Consumption Prediction: Use a machine learning (ML) model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict energy consumption based on historical data.

2. Weather Forecast Integration: Use a deep learning (DL) model (e.g., CNN) to analyze weather forecasts and adjust energy consumption predictions accordingly.

3. API Integration: Design an API using Flask to communicate between models, retrieve weather forecasts, and provide energy consumption predictions to building management systems.
